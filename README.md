# goniometry_tool
Joint goniometry tool for physicians (HTML+Javascript)

This is pure HTML and Javascript tool to be used by physicians who actively work with patients to assess the musculoskeletal system.
The joints to be assessed are selected by each checkbox and using the sliders the movement range of the joint is set. To facilitate the process the tool visualizes the range on the screen.
