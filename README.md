Joint goniometry tool for physicians (HTML+Javascript)

This is pure HTML and Javascript tool to be used by physicians who actively work with patients to assess the musculoskeletal system.
The assessed joints are selected by each checkbox and the movement range is set by the sliders. To facilitate the process the tool visualizes the range on the screen.
